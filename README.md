# Conway-Game-of-Life-with-Kotlin
Just for fun I've tried to develop the Conway's Game of Life in Kotlin. 
I don't think this is a really good implementation of it, so, any suggestion is highly appreciated.

#### Structure

It's a very simple structure, with 3 files and ~120 lines of code. 
- GameOfLifeGenerator.kt is responsable for the logic part of the application
- GameOfLifeWindow.kt just shows the gamefield using the java.swing package
- App.kt is the entry point
